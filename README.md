An ultra-minimal platform for anybody who writes

```

*This project is officially terminated and under public archive, the new and updated version can be found here: [The Abyss](https://github.com/solomonshalom/the-abyss)

That should get frontend to open in your localhost, in-terms of backend (firebase), just create a ```.env``` file in the root of the project with the
approriate variables. Once you have that filled up, everything should be setup!

## Notes

By default, when you make a project in firebase for your application ```firestore database``` won't be by default set. So, please make sure you set it up as it will be storing the user and post data. 

This project was also taken from [ospress](https://ospress.co), the original codebase. At the time, the site wasn't exactly functional and I decided to continue it :D
